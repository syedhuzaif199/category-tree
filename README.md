Generation and visualization of category trees

## Quick Start

### Make sure you have python and pip installed

### On linux:

Activate any virtual environments if needed before running the following in a console:

```console
./install_dependencies.sh
```

You might also need to change the permissions of the file before running it. To do so, run the following in a console:

```console
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
```

### On windows:

You might need to run the following file as an administrator:

```console
install_dependencies.bat
```
